# PracticePad

Hello fellow developers. I'd like to type few words about this project. 
It's been some time since I've started working on it and back then it was a playground for me for trying new technologies. That's why code is not clean, architecture is not set in a proper way, and many things could be optimized. 
After some time I've realized that app is almost MVP, what makes it elegibile to ship it to play store and that's my aim for today. 
Will I do major refactor before release? No. I have other projects to start in mind, which will be led properly from the start, so I don't have time for that. 
Will I do minor cleanup before release? Probably. 
Will I develop this app after release? Probably. 
Will I start new project as a technical playground? Definitely.
